# EU Disinfo Analysis

## Introduction

Over six years time the European Union assembled an archive
of over twelve thousand "disinformation cases".

Each of these issues brings together a claim, and argument
labeling it "disinformation", one or more countries, keywords,
a publication date, language, and one or more sources.

## Data Exploration

Basic data:
* 12000 issues
* 2849 sources (articles or videos on the internet)
* 429 organisations (publishers of articles)
* 94 countries
* 368 keywords

### Data Corrections

* Several of the issues lack full data, e.g.
linked news articles may be missing.
* Duplicates: e.g. organisations being mentioned several times.

_What percentage? What can we say on those issues?_
