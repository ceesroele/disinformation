The coronavirus is a biological weapon deployed alternatively by China, the US, the UK or even Russia (with the aim of destroying the EU and NATO)
The coronavirus did not break out in Wuhan, China – the US is concealing its true origin, which is in fact the US or US-owned laboratories across the world
The outbreak has been caused by migrants and migrants are spreading the virus in the EU
The coronavirus is linked to 5G (e.g., Wuhan as a 5G testing ground)
The EU has failed to handle the crisis – the EU is a disaster for Europe
The EU is not ready to provide urgent support to its Member States – instead, they have to rely on external support (e.g., Italy), with China mentioned most often as the source of such assistance
China is coming to rescue the EU as Brussels abandons EU Member States
Schengen no longer exists – Europeans are in quarantine, but migrants can move freely
The coronavirus is a hoax, it does not exist
The EU could impose mass vaccinations
Cures: claims that natural remedies exist to cure the virus, which are often combined with anti-vaccination narratives
